# RabbitMQ Demo
RabbitMQ Demo Tutorial for DevBrains

RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to live until received.
Also, itâ€™s lightweight and easy to deploy on premises and in the cloud. It supports multiple messaging protocols (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP).
